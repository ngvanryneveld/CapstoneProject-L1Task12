# Finance Calculator
Task 12 - the brief gave us the goal of creating a **financial caluclator** that works either with **bond** calculations or with **investment** calculations.
The investment option takes inputs:
* Amount of money being deposited
* Interest rate as percentage
* Number of years of investment
* Option of simple or compound interest
Once the information has been collected then the ansewr is printed out.

The bond option takes inputs:
* Present value of the house
* Interest rate as percentage
* Number of months they plan to repay in
Once this information has been gathered, the monthly repayments are then calculated for the user and printed out.
